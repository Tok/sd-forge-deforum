Let us know if you are willing to add the desired feature, ideally, leave your Discord handle here, so we will contact you for a less formal conversation. Our community is welcoming and ready to provide you with any information on the project structure or how the code works. If not, however, keep in mind that if you do not want to do your new feature yourself, you will have to wait until the team picks up your issue.
