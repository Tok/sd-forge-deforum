AI Prompt Enhancement - Compatibility Layer

This module provides backward compatibility for the original ai_prompt_enhancement.py
while delegating to the new modular enhancement system.

The original 700+ line file has been split into focused modules:
- data_models.py: Immutable data structures and enums
- model_interface.py: Protocol definitions and model selection  
- core_processing.py: Pure prompt processing functions
- enhancement_engine.py: Core enhancement logic and batch processing
- analysis_reporting.py: Statistics and reporting functions

All functions maintain the same API for backward compatibility.
"""

# Import everything from the new modular system
from .enhancement import *

# Maintain backward compatibility by re-exporting everything that was in the original file
# This allows existing code to continue working without changes

# Original functions are now available through the modular imports:
# - enhance_prompts() -> main enhancement function
# - enhance_prompts_simple() -> simplified interface
# - enhance_prompts_legacy_interface() -> legacy compatibility
# - All data models and processing functions remain the same

# The modular architecture provides:
# ✅ Files under 500 lines (vs original 700+ lines)
# ✅ Single responsibility principle
# ✅ Functional programming patterns maintained
# ✅ Easy testing and maintenance
# ✅ Clear separation of concerns
# ✅ 100% backward compatibility

# Example usage (unchanged from original):
"""
# Basic usage
request = PromptEnhancementRequest(
    prompts={"0": "a cat"},
    language=PromptLanguage.ENGLISH
)
result = enhance_prompts(request, model_service)

# Simplified usage  
result = enhance_prompts_simple(
    prompts={"0": "a cat"},
    model_service=model_service,
    language="english"
)

# Legacy usage
enhanced = enhance_prompts_legacy_interface(
    prompts={"0": "a cat"},
    model_service=model_service
)
