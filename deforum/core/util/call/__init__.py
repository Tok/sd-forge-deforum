"""
This module provides utility functions for simplifying calls to other modules within the `experimental_core.py` module.

**Purpose:**
- **Reduce Argument Complexity:**  Provides a way to call functions in other modules without directly handling
  a large number of complex arguments. This simplifies code within the core by encapsulating argument management.
- **Minimize Namespace Pollution:**  Provides an alternative to overloading methods in the original modules,
  which would introduce the `RenderInit` class into namespaces where it's not inherently needed.

**Structure:**
- **Simple Call Forwarding:** Functions in this module primarily act as wrappers. They perform minimal logic,
  often just formatting or passing arguments, and directly call the corresponding method.
- **Naming Convention:**
    - Function names begin with "call_", followed by the name of the actual method to call.
    - The `data` object is always passed as the first argument.
    - Frame indices (e.g., `frame_idx`, `twin_frame_idx`) are passed as the second argument "i", when relevant.

**Example:**
```python
# Example function in this module
def call_some_function(data, i, ...):
    return some_module.some_function(data.arg77, data.arg.arg.whatever, i, ...)
```
